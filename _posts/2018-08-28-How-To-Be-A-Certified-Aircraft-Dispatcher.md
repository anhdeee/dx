To be a Aircraft Dispatcher, you need to be at least 23 years old, pass a written FAA Aircraft Dispatcher Knowledge Exam (ADX) and Practical examination.

#### Eligibility
In the United States, to take the ADX and practical you can be as young as 21 years old. Just know that the FAA won't certify you until your 23rd birthday ([14 CFR Part 65.53](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=accc6269013833371e13bf182277abc7&mc=true&node=se14.2.65_153&rgn=div8)). A minimum of 200 hours of classroom instruction is required, unless you have prior aviation background. The ADX can only be given at an approved and proctored FAA authorized testing center.

#### Training
Depending on where you get you certification (college or certified FAA school), the standard day schedule is 5-6 weeks straight with 8-hour days of training, which involves a combination engaging lectures, videos and computer based training (CBT) Exam preparation. Check with the school you are interested in as some provide night classes or hybrid online classroom curriculum. For more information about schools, don't hesitate to message me.
