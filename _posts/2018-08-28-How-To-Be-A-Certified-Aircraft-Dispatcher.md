#### Eligibility
In the United States, the only prerequisite for taking the FAA Aircraft Dispatcher Knowledge exam (ADX) is that the applicants must be 21 years old. Once the written exam is completed and passed, the scores are only valid for two years from the date of the examination. The FAA Aircraft Dispatcher written exam can only be given at an approved and proctored FAA authorized testing center.

If you already have aviation or military background, taking the ADX written exam before attending flight dispatch school is an option.

However, if you are coming from a non-aviation background it is suggested you read and study before class as it is a very demanding.

Check with the school you are interested in as some provide night classes or hybrid online and classroom curriculum.

After satisfying the age requirement and passing both the written and oral exam, you are on your way of starting your career in Aircraft Dispatching.
